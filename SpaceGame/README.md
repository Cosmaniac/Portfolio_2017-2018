### Space Game

This is a game where you pilot a small rocketship and click to fire lasers, destroying enemy ships. The bottom picture shows the spaceship firing lasers, which cause the enemy ships to disappear when contact is made. The player-controlled spaceship is controlled with the mouse, and the enemy spaceships fall down the screen from randomly spawned x-positions.
